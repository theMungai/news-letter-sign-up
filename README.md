## Acknowledgments

I am thrilled to acknowledge the completion of the Frontend Mentor Newsletter Sign-up Challenge, where I had the opportunity to apply and deepen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This challenge allowed me to design and implement a responsive, user-friendly newsletter sign-up form, focusing on both aesthetic appeal and functionality. Working through the layout and styling in CSS and handling form validation with JavaScript has strengthened my understanding of these core technologies. I am grateful for the hands-on learning experience this project provided, which has certainly enhanced my capabilities as a front-end developer.
